##Main
###Week 1: Sketching / Wireframing (Ideas)
Sketching everything up the first week, I tried a few different ideas, <br>
but I realised after a week that the implementation would not be as expected, and <br>
I have learned that I have a habit of making projects harder for myself. <br>
So I trashed most parts of the initial ideas, and followed the KISS-rule. <br>

###Week 2: HTML / CSS (Structuring)
Making the website with HTML and CSS went fairly "fast". <br>
I think I spent about 1,5 week all together on making the structure, <br>
and styling. I was lucky with the external project. <br>

###Week 3: JS (Information Overload)
Everything started out pretty good, I was confident that it would turn out the way I imagined it. <br>
But, as it turned out, implementing it was a lot easier theoretically, and I spent a long time <br>
solving the function-problem in my head, than actually doing it and working on the project. <br>

I wasted too much time in my **head**, and reading on **MDN**, **w3schools**, <br>
**youtube**, **wordpress articles/docs**, **codecadamy** and other **"random" articles/websites**.

I learned a lot, but a lot did not help me with the specific challenge at hand. <br>
Hence "wasted" time.

###Week 4: JS ()
I had to pay for my wasted time, cause the last few days I sat there, <br>
juggling between my "well"-thought-out-plans and KISS <br>
